# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

A Football Journey

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A choose your own adventure game where you are a football player making decisions about what school to go to, if you want to be traded, etc. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will start by asking the user if they want to play our game. If they choose yes, they will then enter their name and the game will begin. The game will prompt them with a number of questions that will determine their journey as a football player. Examples of questions will include choosing what college to go to, choosing if you want to enter the draft, and choosing if you want to be traded to another team. Our program will contain lots of conditional statements. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NA

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Completely text based choose your own adventure game that takes you through your career as a football player.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We could add some visuals to make it more entertaining for the user.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We could create a completely interactive choose your own adventure game, complete with words, visuals, and sounds. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We will look into renpy to help us with how to create our game. We will split the work evenly and each write code for certain parts of the game. For example, I could write the part of the program that prompts the user for what college they want to go to, and Dylan could write the part of the program that will prompt the user if they want to be traded to another team.
